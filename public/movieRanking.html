 <h1>The best movies according to Aseem</h1>
 <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
<h2>Shawshank Redemption</h2>
<img src = "../assets/images/shawshank.jpg", alt = "Shawshank Redemption movie poster", height="200">
<p>A timeless classic. Wherever there is hope, there is this movie.</p>
<h2>Interstellar</h2>
<img src = "../assets/images/Interstellar.jpg", alt = "Interstellar movie poster", height="200">
<p>Christofer Nolan's best, according to me. A real adventure for space enthusiasts and string theorists.</p>
<h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
<img src = "../assets/images/thedarkknight.avif", alt = "The image of Batman and Joker", height="200">
<p>Again Nolan. Makes you question world order. And yeah Christian Bale was awesome in this. Probably the best Batman.</p>
