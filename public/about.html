  <p>Hey there! I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for coding and a knack for problem-solving. Armed with my trusty trio of programming languagesâ€”Java, C++, and Pythonâ€”I'm on a mission to conquer the digital world. Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the vast ocean of web development, navigating through the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the occasional SOS call to Stack Overflow).</p>
  <p>When I'm not tangled up in code, you can find me crafting an Android app using Android Studio. It's my pet project, and let's just say it's a rollercoaster of debugging thrills and feature-building chills! I've also taken a few DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) courses, and I enjoy the challenge of finding the most efficient way to solve problems.</p>
  <p>With a blend of curiosity, determination, and a sprinkle of humor, I'm always eager to learn and grow. Whether it's creating seamless user experiences on the web or building the next big app, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. So, if you're looking for a tech enthusiast who loves a good coding challenge (and a good laugh), I'm your person! ðŸš€</p>
